# Money Transfer Application

## Overview
A simple **Money Transfer Application** that includes a **server-side backend API** built with Spring Boot and a **CLI-based client** that interacts with the API. The system allows users to register, authenticate, manage their bank accounts, send/receive money, and view transaction history. It also includes administrative features for managing users and accounts.

The **backend API** follows a RESTful architecture, exposing endpoints for account management, transactions, and authentication. The **CLI client** serves as the user interface, allowing users to perform operations by making API requests and displaying results in a user-friendly format.

## Core Features

  âœ… Create an account and log in securely via CLI (calls backend API).

- **Account Management**  
  âœ… View account balance and update profile details.

- **Money Transfers**

- **Transaction History**  
  âœ… View past money transfers with detailed information.

- **Error Handling**
